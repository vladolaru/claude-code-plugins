# Marp Slide Quality Analyzer

This Skill uses SlideGauge to analyze Marp markdown presentations and help you create high-quality slides that follow best practices.

## When to use this Skill

- User is working on a Marp presentation (`.md` file with `marp: true` frontmatter)
- User asks to check, analyze, validate, or improve slide quality
- User mentions SlideGauge or slide quality issues
- User wants to fix specific slide problems (too many bullets, long content, etc.)

## Instructions

### 1. Initial Analysis

When user asks to analyze their slides:

```bash
# Run SlideGauge with text output for quick overview
uvx --from git+https://github.com/nibzard/slidegauge slidegauge <path-to-presentation.md> --text
```

**Explain the results:**
- Overall score and passing rate
- Number of issues found
- Category breakdown (a11y, code, color, content, layout)

### 2. Detailed Analysis

For slides that need fixing (score < 80):

```bash
# Get JSON output with detailed diagnostics
uvx --from git+https://github.com/nibzard/slidegauge slidegauge <path-to-presentation.md> --json | jq '.slides[] | select(.score < 80)'
```

**For each failing slide, identify:**
- Exact slide number and title
- Specific issues with deduction amounts
- Actionable recommendations

### 3. Fix Common Issues

Use the Edit tool to fix issues. See [FIXES.md](FIXES.md) for specific fix patterns.

**Common fixes:**

- **Too many bullets**: Split into multiple slides or consolidate
- **Content too long**: Trim text or split slide
- **Code too long**: Simplify examples or split
- **Too many lines**: Reduce content density
- **Title too long**: Shorten to ≤35 characters

### 4. Validate Fixes

After making changes, re-run SlideGauge:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/nibzard/slidegauge slidegauge <path-to-presentation.md> --text
```

Compare before/after scores and confirm improvements.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Run SlideGauge to get baseline scores
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on slides scoring < 70 first, then < 80
3. **Fix**: Apply fixes from FIXES.md based on diagnostics
4. **Validate**: Re-run to confirm improvements
5. **Iterate**: Repeat until all slides pass (≥70) or user is satisfied

## Key Thresholds

- **70**: Minimum passing score (slides below this MUST be fixed)
- **80**: Good quality (recommend fixing these)
- **90+**: Excellent quality
- **100**: Perfect score

## Category Scores

- **a11y**: Accessibility (alt text, contrast)
- **code**: Code block length and complexity
- **color**: Color usage and contrast ratios
- **content**: Text length, bullets, line count
- **layout**: Overall slide structure

## Best Practices

1. **Always show user the results** - don't just fix silently
2. **Explain WHY** each fix improves the slide
3. **Get user approval** before making major changes (splitting slides, removing content)
4. **Preserve user intent** - don't change technical content
5. **Re-validate after fixes** to show improvement

## Examples

See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for detailed examples of:
- Analyzing a full presentation
- Fixing specific slide issues
- Splitting overloaded slides
- Optimizing code examples

## Reference

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for complete SlideGauge rule documentation.

## Dependencies

SlideGauge is installed via uvx on-demand:
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/nibzard/slidegauge slidegauge --help
```

No manual installation required - uvx handles it automatically.
